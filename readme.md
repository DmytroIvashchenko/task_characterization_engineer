The project is a test tasks for the Characterization Engineer position

The first task was to develop a script for measuring voltage, the input range is 0...3.3V, NPLC: 1,5,10.
It was made in two versions Raspberry - folder first task folder Raspberry; 
Arduino - folder first task folder Arduino.

The second task was to find the statistical parameters for a particular date set. 
Performed using the principles of OOP file in the second task folder oop_version; 
principles of functional programming file in the second task folder func_version

the data_values file contains the specified date set
the const file contains constants that we refer to in the oop_version, func_version files

the one_line file is an attempt to put the execution of this task in one line 
(this is not a pure code execution, it's just more of a joke)
